Week Three Notes.
-I revised all the java collections. I also found that the minor errors started producing like big errors and I found a way to
remove the issue.

-I tried setting UP a server, of which should be able to run and bring back a message; or so the example says. I read over it. I
know that it is supposed to run since I watched a similar code on youtube work just fine. I just do not know it is not running
with me. It was mentioned that possibly the android library needs to be installed for it to run, is that true?

Well any help you can show me would be great since being able to have an android app/device communicate with a website would be
almost as important as haveing the classes able to talk among themselves.
